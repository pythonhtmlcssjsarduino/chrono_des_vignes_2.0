# Course Management

The course management page allows you to start and stop the courses of the current edition.

At the top of the page, there is a tab for each course.

## Details for Each Course

In each course's tab, you can see the status and progress of each runner. The color code helps you quickly see the runner's state:

- :fontawesome-solid-circle:{.fg-danger} **Disqualified or Dropped Out**
- :fontawesome-solid-circle:{.fg-success} **Finished following the course**
- :fontawesome-solid-circle:{.fg-warning} **Finished without following the course**
- :fontawesome-solid-circle:{.fg-primary} **In the race**
- :fontawesome-solid-circle:{.fg-info} **Not started**

## Start the Course

Above the runners, when the course hasn't started, there's a button to launch the course.

## Stop the Course

If the course has started, the button changes to end the course.
