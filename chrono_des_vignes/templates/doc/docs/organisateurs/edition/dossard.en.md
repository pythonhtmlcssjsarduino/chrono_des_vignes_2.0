# Registered Runners Management

On this page, you can access the list of registered runners for this edition. You can:

## Edit Bib Numbers

- **Manually**: Change the bib number of each runner with the :fontawesome-solid-pen-to-square: icon next to the bib number.
- **Automatically**: Generate all bib numbers in one click using the **generate** button.

## Manage Presence

From this page, you can manage runners' presence in the right column. Be careful: if this is done incorrectly, unregistered runners will be marked as absent even if they are running.

## Export Data

You can export each runner's data in Excel format to create bibs via mail merge.

## Add Last-Minute Runners

To add a new runner:

1. Click on the **"Add a new runner"** button.
2. In the popup, fill out the required fields.

### Register an Already Registered Runner

If the runner is already registered in the app, you only need to enter:
- Last name
- First name
- Date of birth
- Course

If the runner is found, another popup will appear with a list of matching users. Just click the box next to the correct runner to register them.
