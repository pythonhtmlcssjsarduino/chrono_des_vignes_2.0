    To create timing keys, the edition must not have taken place yet (you can no longer modify them on the same day of the edition).

The first section of the timing page for the edition allows you to create timing keys.

### Create a Timing Key
Below the timing keys, there is the section to create a new timing key. Each key has a name and is linked to at least one stand of a course.

## View Logged Passages
At the bottom of the page, you can view all recorded passages and the key that recorded them.
