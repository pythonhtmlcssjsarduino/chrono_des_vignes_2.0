## Edit a Course
!!! warning "Warning"
    To edit a course, it must not be used in any edition. If you want to create a modified version, you need to create a [copy of the course](#create-a-copy-of-the-course).

- You can edit the course name and description (can be formatted with [markdown](index.md#description-in-markdown)) in the first section of the edition page.
- To edit the course itself, follow the next sections.

### Add a Stage
- A course is made up of a sequence of stages. Each stage contains a track followed by a stand. Only the first stand has no track and cannot be deleted.

  - In the list of stages of your course, on the right of the page, find where you want to add the new stage.
  - Click the plus there. The page will reload and a blue banner will appear above the map.
  - Click on the desired location on the map. A pop-up will open.
- In the pop-up, fill out the form:

    | Field                 | Explanation                                   |
    |----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
    | Stand Name           | Name of the stand                             |
